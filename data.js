This Belgian Dubbel has been cold steeped with Ethiopian Yirgacheffe roasted by our close friends at Kudu coffee. This addition of coffee blends seamlessly with the classic Belgian yeast profile and has nuances of strawberries and cream, green pepper, and whispers of roast. We don’t wake up every morning with a beer, but when we do, it’s Breakfast and Brunettes!",
